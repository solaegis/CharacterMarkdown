# Release Checklist

**Use this checklist before every release to ensure production readiness.**

This checklist covers all aspects of preparing CharacterMarkdown for release: code quality, documentation, build validation, testing, and deployment.

---

## 🤖 Quick Start: Automated Pre-Release Validation

**For Cursor AI or manual execution:**

```bash
# Run comprehensive pre-release validation (RECOMMENDED)
task release:check

# Or use individual commands
task test              # Lint + validate
task build             # Build and validate ZIP
task validate          # All validations (files, manifest, syntax, changelog)

# View interactive checklist
task release:checklist

# Guided release workflow (interactive)
task release           # or: task release:workflow
```

**📖 See [docs/RELEASE_TASKS_REFERENCE.md](docs/RELEASE_TASKS_REFERENCE.md) for complete task command reference**

**Cursor AI can automatically run these checks:**
- ✅ Code linting (`task lint`)
- ✅ All validations (`task validate`)
- ✅ Syntax validation (`task validate:syntax`)
- ✅ Manifest validation (`task validate:manifest`)
- ✅ README.md badges (`task validate:readme`)
- ✅ Build validation (`task build`)
- ✅ Comprehensive pre-release check (`task release:check`)

- [ ] **Example Files Cleanup**
  ```bash
  task examples:trim:dry-run   # Preview changes
  task examples:trim           # Trim unnecessary newlines
  ```
  - ✅ Remove chunk markers from example files
  - ✅ Remove excessive padding (550+ trailing newlines)
  - ✅ Reduce consecutive blank lines (3+ → 2)
  - ✅ All markdown structure preserved
  - ℹ️  Example files in `assets/examples/` should be clean for distribution

- ✅ Validate ZIP structure
- ✅ Create GitHub release
- ✅ Upload to ESOUI (if configured)

#### Manual Steps

- [ ] **Create and Push Tag**
  ```bash
  # Recommended (interactive with confirmation):
  task release:tag
  
  # Or step-by-step:
  task git:tag                    # Creates tag locally
  git push origin main --tags     # Push to GitHub (triggers Actions)
  ```

- [ ] **Monitor GitHub Actions**
  - [ ] Check Actions tab for workflow run
  - [ ] Verify all steps pass
  - [ ] Check for any errors or warnings

- [ ] **Verify Release**
  - [ ] GitHub release created
  - [ ] Release ZIP downloadable
  - [ ] ESOUI upload successful (if automated)
  - [ ] Version number correct on ESOUI

---

### 9. Post-Release Verification

## 🚀 Quick Release Workflow

**Option 1: Guided Interactive Workflow (Recommended)**

```bash
# Run guided release workflow - walks you through all steps
task release
```

**Option 2: Manual Step-by-Step Workflow**

```bash
# 1. Run automated validation
task release:check

# 2. Bump version (if needed)
task version:bump -- patch   # or minor/major

# 3. Update CHANGELOG.md manually
# Add release notes for new version

# 4. Final validation
task test
task build

# 5. Commit and tag
git add .
task git:commit -- "Release v<version>"
task release:tag -- @project-version@     # Interactive with version (prompts before push)

# 6. Monitor GitHub Actions
# Check Actions tab for automated release
```

**Option 3: Use Helper Commands**

```bash
# Display checklist
task release:checklist

# View release help
task help:release

# Install git hooks for automatic validation before pushing tags
task git:hooks:install
```

---

## 🔧 Git Hooks Setup (Optional)

### Install Pre-Push Hook

**Option 1: Using Task (Recommended)**

```bash
# Install pre-push hook
task git:hooks:install

# Test the hook
task git:hooks:test

# Uninstall if needed
task git:hooks:uninstall
```

**Option 2: Manual Installation**

```bash
# Copy hook template
cp scripts/git-hooks/pre-push .git/hooks/pre-push
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-push
```

The pre-push hook will:
- ✅ Run validation before pushing tags
- ✅ Prevent push if validation fails
- ✅ Skip validation for non-tag pushes (optional)

To bypass the hook if needed:
```bash
git push --no-verify
```

### Manual Pre-Release Check

```bash
# Run comprehensive pre-release validation (recommended)
task release:check

# Or run the script directly
./scripts/pre-release-check.sh
```

These run all automated checks from the checklist.
