# Necro/Nightblade Assassination Hybrid - Transitional Build Guide (Updated for U44 & U48)

> [!NOTE]
> **Update 48 (Q4 2025) Status:**
> This guide incorporates changes from Update 48.
> - **Necromancer:** "Bone Armor" now grants a **"Living Corpse"** effect when it ends or is recast, allowing you to use a corpse-consumer ability (like Boneyard) on yourself without a physical corpse. This is a massive QoL improvement for reliability.
> - **Nightblade:** No significant changes to the core Assassination/Shadow skills used in this build.


## Build Definition

**Final Configuration (Post-Subclassing):**
- **Keep:** Necromancer Grave Lord (Blastbones, Boneyard)
- **Replace:** Necromancer Living Death → **Nightblade: Assassination**
- **Replace:** Necromancer Bone Tyrant → **Nightblade: Shadow**

**Build Identity:** Stealth assassin bomber combining Necromancer's delayed burst with Nightblade's stealth mechanics and execute power. Delivers 22-35k damage in 2-second windows from stealth, then escapes via Shadow Cloak.

**Core Synergies:**
- **Blighted Blastbones** (Necro) + Dizzy Swing (2H) + Dawnbreaker = bomb combo
- Nightblade stealth passives (+35% damage from stealth)
- Killer's Blade (NB) superior execute
- **Shadow Cloak** (NB) guaranteed escape tool (now a toggle)
- Stuhn's Favor (gear) +15% crit damage on Off Balance targets

---

## Transitional Philosophy

**Problem:** You can't use Nightblade skills until you unlock subclassing (level 50 ✓) and level NB lines to rank 50 (3+ weeks).

**Solution:** Build a "proto-bomber" using only Necromancer + weapon skills that:
1. Works effectively in PvE/Overland TODAY
2. Uses identical gear/stats/rotation structure as final build
3. Minimizes skill point waste (avoid Living Death/Bone Tyrant actives you'll replace)
4. Teaches bomber fundamentals before adding NB complexity

**Key Principle:** Spend skill points on things that stay in final build. Avoid temporary skills.

## Phase 1: Pre-Subclass Necro Bomber (Weeks 1-3)

### Skill Point Allocation (Strategic Investment)

#### Priority 1: Skills That Stay Forever (60 points)

| Priority | Skill/Passive | Line | Points | Stays in Final? | Why Critical |

| 4 | Dawnbreaker → Dawnbreaker of Smiting | Fighters Guild | 2 | ✅ YES | Primary ultimate |
| **ACTIVE SKILLS - BACK BAR** |
| 5 | Boneyard → Avid Boneyard | Necro: Grave Lord | 2 | ✅ YES | Major Breach debuff |
| 6 | Poison Arrow → Poison Injection | Bow | 2 | ✅ YES | Ranged DoT pressure |
| 7 | Vigor → Resolving Vigor | Assault (PvP) | 2 | ✅ YES | Primary HoT |
| **TEMPORARY SLOTS** |
| 8 | Reverse Slice → Executioner | Two-Handed | 2 | ❌ NO (replaced by Killer's Blade) | Temporary execute |
| 9 | ANY basic shield/heal | Any | 2 | ❌ NO (replaced by Shadow Cloak) | Temporary survival |
| 10 | ANY mobility skill | Any | 2 | ❌ NO (replaced by Ambush) | Temporary gap closer |
| **NECRO PASSIVES (GRAVE LORD ONLY)** |
| 11 | Death Gleaning (Rank 2) | Necro: Grave Lord | 2 | ✅ YES | Ultimate generation |
| 12 | Dismember (Rank 2) | Necro: Grave Lord | 2 | ✅ YES | +3% crit per corpse |
| 13 | Reusable Parts (Rank 2) | Necro: Grave Lord | 2 | ✅ YES | -15% Blastbones cost |
| 14 | Rapid Rot (Rank 2) | Necro: Grave Lord | 2 | ⚠️ OPTIONAL | DoT damage (minor) |
| **WEAPON PASSIVES** |
| 15-20 | Two-Handed (all passives Rank 2) | Two-Handed | 12 | ✅ YES | All critical for combo |
| 21-25 | Bow (all passives Rank 2) | Bow | 10 | ✅ YES | Ranged pressure |
| 26-30 | Medium Armor (all passives Rank 2) | Medium Armor | 10 | ✅ YES | Crit/damage/sustain |
| **GUILD PASSIVES** |

**Subtotal: 60 points invested in permanent skills**

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Blastbones Change:** We use **Blighted Blastbones** (Stamina morph) because the other morph, *Grave Lord's Sacrifice*, is now a self-buff and no longer creates a bomb. Blighted Blastbones also applies Major Defile, reducing enemy healing.

---

#### Priority 2: Temporary Skills (Minimal Investment) (12 points)

**These are placeholders until you get Nightblade skills:**

| Slot | Temporary Skill | Points | Replaced By | When |
|------|-----------------|--------|-------------|------|
| Front Bar Slot 5 | **Deaden Pain** (Necro Living Death) | 2 | None (becomes Grim Focus slot) | Week 4 |

| Back Bar Slot 4 | **Skeletal Archer** (Necro Grave Lord) | 2 | Ambush (NB Shadow) | Week 4 |
| Back Bar Ult | **Ravenous Goliath** (Necro Bone Tyrant) | 2 | Incapacitating Strike (NB Assassination) | Week 4 |
| Utility | **Any 2 flex skills** | 4 | Various | Variable |

**Subtotal: 12 points in temporary skills that will be respecced**

---

#### Priority 3: Reserve (35 points)

**DO NOT SPEND THESE YET:**
- 30 points for Nightblade Assassination (week 4+)
- 30 points for Nightblade Shadow (week 4+)
- You have 107 total, spending 72 now leaves 35 available

**Total Current Spend: 72/107 points**

---

### Phase 1 Skill Bars (Pre-Subclass)

**Front Bar: 2-Handed Sword**
1. **Dizzy Swing** → Wrecking Blow (Off Balance)

### Phase 2 Skill Point Additions (+60 points)

**When both NB lines hit Rank 50, spend 60 additional points:**

2. Vigor + potion while invisible
3. Kite away or reposition
4. Toggle Shadow Cloak OFF (Save Magicka!)
5. Wait 7s for CC immunity to expire
6. Re-engage with stealth opener

## Critical Success Factors

### ✅ DO THIS:
1. **Spend skill points conservatively** - Only 72 points in Phase 1
2. **Farm gear early** - Same gear for both phases
3. **Practice Phase 1 rotation** - Builds muscle memory for Phase 2
4. **Level NB lines actively** - Slot skills, play content
5. **Save 35 skill points** - For NB skills when ready

### ❌ DON'T DO THIS:
1. **Don't invest in Living Death/Bone Tyrant passives** - You'll replace these lines
2. **Don't farm different gear** - The build uses same gear throughout
3. **Don't skip Phase 1 practice** - You need bomber fundamentals first
4. **Don't rush to subclass** - Level NB lines to 50 first or you waste time
