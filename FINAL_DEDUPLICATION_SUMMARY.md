# Final Data Deduplication Summary

## 🎯 Goal
Eliminate all duplicate data in markdown output for a cleaner, more efficient character sheet.

## ✅ Changes Made

### 1. **Character Progression Section → REMOVED**
**Previous behavior:**
- Had its own section showing: Skill Points, Attribute Points, Achievement Score, Vampire, Werewolf, Enlightenment

**Problem:**
- Skill Points → Duplicated in Quick Stats + Attention Needed
- Attribute Points → Duplicated in Attention Needed
- Achievement Score → Duplicated in Quick Stats
- Vampire/Werewolf/Enlightenment → Rare data, doesn't need own section

**Solution:**
- Section completely removed
- Vampire/Werewolf/Enlightenment moved to Character Overview table (conditional)
- Other data already handled elsewhere

---

### 2. **Title Location → HEADER**
**Previous behavior:**
- Title shown in Character Overview table

**Problem:**
- Takes up table space for prominent info that should be in header

**Solution:**
- Title now in header: `# Masisi, *Daedric Lord Slayer*`
- Removed from Character Overview table

---

### 3. **Character Overview → Enhanced**
**New conditional fields added:**
- **🧛 Vampire** - Only shows if character is vampire (with stage number)
- **🐺 Werewolf** - Only shows if character is werewolf
- **✨ Enlightenment** - Only shows if enlightenment is active (with progress)

**Benefits:**
- All character-specific data in one place
- No separate sections for rare statuses
- Cleaner document structure

## 🎯 Smart Conditionals

### Character Overview Conditionals:
```lua
-- Only show vampire if character is vampire
if progressionData and progressionData.isVampire then
    markdown = markdown .. "| **🧛 Vampire** | Stage " .. vampireStage .. " |\n"
end

-- Only show werewolf if character is werewolf
if progressionData and progressionData.isWerewolf then
    markdown = markdown .. "| **🐺 Werewolf** | Active |\n"
end

-- Only show enlightenment if it's active (max > 0)
if progressionData and progressionData.enlightenment.max > 0 then
    markdown = markdown .. "| **✨ Enlightenment** | ... |\n"
end
```

**Result:** Most characters will have 0-1 of these fields. Only shows relevant data.
