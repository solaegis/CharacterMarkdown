- [ ] **Burst Damage** - High damage in short windows
- [ ] **Sustained DPS** - Consistent damage over time
- [ ] **Execute Specialist** - Dominates low-health phases
- [ ] **AoE Focused** - Excels at multi-target situations
- [ ] **Single-Target** - Optimized for boss fights
- [ ] **Tank/Spank** - Simple rotation, stat-dependent
- [ ] **Complex Rotation** - High APM, timing-dependent
- [ ] **Group Utility** - Provides buffs/debuffs to team
- [ ] **Solo Sustain** - Self-sufficient in all content
- [ ] **Glass Cannon** - Maximum damage, minimal defense

```
[Back Bar]
1. DoT Skill 1 → 
2. DoT Skill 2 → 
3. Buff Skill → 
4. DoT Skill 3 → 
5. Bar Swap

[Front Bar]
6. DoT Skill 4 → 
7. Direct Damage Skill → 
8. Spammable x3 → 
9. Bar Swap
```

**Opening Burst:** [Expected damage in first 10s]

**Cycle Duration:** [Seconds - e.g., 12s]

```
[Front Bar] (Stay 8s)
- Spammable x5
- Direct Damage Skill (when off cooldown)
- Proc weapon enchant every 4 light attacks

[Back Bar] (Stay 4s)  
- Refresh DoT 1 (if <3s remaining)
- Refresh DoT 2 (if <3s remaining)
- Buff Skill (if <5s remaining)
- Heavy Attack if sustain needed
```

## Troubleshooting & Optimization

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### Issue: Low DPS
**Symptoms:** [Parsing below target by X%]

**Diagnostic Steps:**
1. Check CMX parse data for:
   - Light attack % (should be >75%)
   - Skill uptime (DoTs should be >90%)
