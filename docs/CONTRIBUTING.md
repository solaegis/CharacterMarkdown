## Style Guidelines

### Lua Code Style

**Indentation:**
- Use 4 spaces (no tabs)

**Naming Conventions:**
```lua
-- Variables: camelCase
local playerName = "Example"

-- Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
local MAX_LEVEL = 50

-- Functions: PascalCase (public), camelCase (private)
function CM.GenerateMarkdown(format)
    local function formatSection()
        -- ...
    end
end

-- Namespaces: PascalCase
CharacterMarkdown = CharacterMarkdown or {}
```

**Comments:**
```lua
-- Single-line for brief explanations

--[[
    Multi-line for:
    - Function documentation
    - Complex logic
    - TODOs
]]

--- LuaDoc-style for public APIs
--- @param format string The output format
--- @return string Generated markdown
function CM.GenerateMarkdown(format)
    -- Implementation
end
```

**Error Handling:**
```lua
-- Always use pcall for ESO API calls
local success, result = pcall(function()
    return GetPlayerStat(STAT_HEALTH_MAX)
end)

if not success then
    CM.Log("ERROR: " .. tostring(result))
    return defaultValue
end
```

### Documentation Style

**Markdown:**
- Use ATX-style headers (`#`, `##`, `###`)
- Include table of contents for long documents
- Use code fences with language tags
- Add blank lines around headers and code blocks

**Comments in Code:**
- Explain "why", not "what"
- Document gotchas and workarounds
- Reference ESO API version if relevant

### Commit Messages

Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

**Good examples:**
```
feat(collectors): add antiquities progress tracking
fix(markdown): escape special characters in item names
docs(api): document EditBox clipboard limitations
refactor(ui): extract window creation logic
```

**Bad examples:**
```
fixed bug

WIP
```
