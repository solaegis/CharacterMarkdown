- Progress: ████████░░
- Emojis for instant recognition

### 4. Scannability
- Compact tables for overview
- Progress bars for quick assessment
- Whitespace for breathing room
- Clear section separation

### 5. Actionability
- Warnings include guidance
- Problems auto-detected
- Context always provided
- Clear next steps

### 6. Zero Duplication
- Single source of truth
- Conditional display
- Related data grouped
- No redundant sections

## 🔄 Backward Compatibility

### All new features are opt-in:

CharacterMarkdownSettings = {
    includeQuickStats = true,          -- Default: true
    includeAttentionNeeded = true,     -- Default: true
    -- All other existing settings unchanged
}
```

### To disable:
```lua
CharacterMarkdownSettings.includeQuickStats = false
CharacterMarkdownSettings.includeAttentionNeeded = false
```

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Testing:
1. ✅ Code written and linted (no errors)
2. ✅ Preview file created (Masisi_Enhanced_Preview.md)
3. ⏳ In-game testing needed:
   - Load ESO with updated addon
   - Run `/cm generate` command
   - Test with multiple characters (different states)
   - Verify vampire/werewolf conditionals
   - Test empty Attention Needed section

### Future Considerations:
1. **Refactoring** - Split Markdown.lua into modular files (~200-300 lines each)
2. **User Feedback** - Gather opinions on new layout
3. **Settings UI** - Add tooltips explaining new sections
4. **Documentation** - Update user-facing README
