# Changelog

All notable changes to Character Markdown will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Class Skill Filtering:** Skill Progression section now only shows class skill lines for the player's actual class
  - Nightblades no longer see Dragonknight skills (Ardent Flame, Draconic Power, Earthen Heart)
  - Templars no longer see Sorcerer skills (Daedric Summoning, Dark Magic, Storm Calling)
  - Applies to all 7 classes: Dragonknight, Nightblade, Sorcerer, Templar, Warden, Necromancer, Arcanist
  - Non-class skills (Weapon, Armor, World, Guild, Alliance War, Craft) still show all available
  - Significantly reduces clutter in the Skill Progression section

### Fixed
- **EditBox Text Color:** Fixed invisible text in output window
  - Text was being generated correctly but invisible due to missing color attribute
  - Added `color="INTERFACE_COLOR_TYPE_TEXT_COLORS:INTERFACE_TEXT_COLOR_NORMAL"` to EditBox in XML
  - Text now displays properly with normal ESO interface text color

### Changed
- **Champion Points Table Format:** Champion Points summary now uses compact table format
- **EditBox Character Limit:** Increased from 50,000 to 500,000 characters to support all new sections
- **Error Handling:** Added comprehensive error detection and reporting throughout

  - Verifies window controls exist before attempting to display
  - Each data collection function wrapped in pcall() with individual error reporting
  - Shows exactly which data collector failed and why
  - Helps diagnose issues with detailed error messages in chat

  - Easier to read and more space-efficient
  - Example:
    ```
    | Category | Value |
    | Total    | 618   |
    | Spent    | 0     |
    | Available| 618   |
    ```

### Removed
- **Racial Skills Section:** Removed entire Racial category from Skill Progression output
  - Players only have access to their own race's skills anyway
